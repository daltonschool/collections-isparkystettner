H period collections assignment
========================
Complete a function for each data structure: stack, deque, list, set.

## getting started

clone the files to your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/daltonschool/CS3A-collections-TEAMNAME.git
```

then you can work locally.

When you have finsihed and tested a function, commit to the repo

```
git commit -a -m "message, fixes #2"
```

Then merge your local repository with the remote repository

```
git pull
git mergetool
git commit
git push
```

You must write code on your own, but you may help your peers with concepts.
